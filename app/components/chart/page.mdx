# Chart

Shadcn native does not have a chart component yet. We recommend using [victory-native](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory-native/) for charts right now and styling it to match your design system.

Another option is to use a web view to render the chart from shadcn ui. A potentional downside is when using a web view you can't have native children.
