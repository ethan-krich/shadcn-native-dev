        Describe the problem that this change intends to solve. Don't get into how it solves it yet.

        This can be brief, but if there is any additional context or any empathy-building that you'd like to communicate, 
        it can't hurt to include it with plenty of detail and hypothetical examples.

        Things that can help: clearly defining terms, providing example content, pseudocode, etc.

        Feel free to mention key implementation concerns.
      placeholder: |
        Describe your proposed solution. Include:
        - How it works
        - API design (if applicable)
        - Example usage
        - Implementation considerations

      description: Raise any concerns here for things you aren't sure about yet
      placeholder: |
        - What are the potential edge cases?
        - Are there alternative approaches to consider?

      label: Answered Questions
      description: |
        If there were any major concerns that have already (or eventually, through the RFC process) reached consensus, 
        it can still help to include them along with their resolution, if it's otherwise unclear.

        This can be especially useful for RFCs that have taken a long time and there were some subtle yet important details to get right.

        This may very well be empty if the proposal is simple enough.
